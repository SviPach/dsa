# Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

## Description

**Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)** is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. It is widely used for secure communications, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. This project demonstrates the implementation of DSA in C# using Windows Forms, providing a graphical user interface for ease of use.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generate private and public keys for signing and verification.
- **Signing**: Digitally sign messages to ensure authenticity.
- **Verification**: Verify the authenticity of received messages.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User-friendly interface built with Windows Forms for ease of use.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs are valid and formatted correctly before processing.
